# Advance Animations with UIKit
## WWDC 2017 - Session 230

This repo contains a project demonstrating the "Sam's Photo" animations seen in the [_Advance Animation with UIKit_ WWDC 2017 session](https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2017/230lc4n1loob9/230/230_advanced_animations_with_uikit.pdf).

Mr. Joe Cerra, from Apple's UIKit Engineer team, gave an amazing presentation at WWDC 2017. In ~40 min, he discussed some of the great animations you can achieve with `UIViewPropertyAnimator`. Unfortunately, Mr. Cerra was unable to go into depth of all the implementation details for the animations he demonstrated. Also, there isn't a working Source code example to go along with his presentation at the moment.

This repo is to mirror the "interactive and  interruptible" animations seen during the presentation:

- [x] Frame animator
- [x] Blur animator
- [x] Rounded Corner animator
- [ ] View Morphing
- [ ] Key frame animations

Project is **WIP**.

Feedback and contributions are always welcomed. ❤️
